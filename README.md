# DDD Essentials.

DDD Essentials is a bunch of contracts that allows a quick setup of a nicely layered Domain Driven Design application in PHP.

## Requirements.

We use PHP 7 by default. I think that DDD should be considered at the start of your project so going for PHP 7 shouldn't be a problem.

## Contributing.

Please feel free to contribute by any means.

I am actually still missing some concepts such as Sagas, so feel free to suggest your contracts.
